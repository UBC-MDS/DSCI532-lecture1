## Answer

Option (a) is correct
- Dashboards use to have widgets that allow the user interact with the interface, what made them similar to web apps. 
- Dashboards are specifically designed to display and monitor data.

---

## What is a data dashboard?

> An **information management tool** that visually tracks, analyzes, and displays key performance indicators, metrics, as well as key data points, allowing you to monitor the current state of your business, department, team, or specific process.

## Packages / technologies used to create Dashboads


![](img/tech.png)
---

## Tableau and Power BI

- drag and drop GUI interface (not coding!)
- easier to implement but less possible customization

## How to select the best available technology?
- short-term or long-term solution?
- cost / financial aspect
- data arquitecture - Is compatible with other technology that I am using?

## Why this software / technology and not anoother one?
- Ease of use
- Software maturity
- Features and flexibility
- Hardware requirements

## What will we learn in DSCI 532?


- **[R]** Shiny  
- **[Python]** Dash

::: footer
New! [Shiny for python](https://shiny.rstudio.com/py/)
:::


---

## Why Shiny?

**Mature web app framework**
- Special packages for testing the app are available (`Shinytest2`)
- Extensive documentation (including books)
- New! Shiny for python (It is still not ready for production apps)

---

## Why Dash?

- It is a stable and well documented solution for Python apps.
- It is more similar to Shiny than other technologies.

## What is a Shiny app?

A Shiny app is a web page (UI) connected to a computer running a live R session (Server)

# Which are the main components of a Shiny App?

1. User interface (frontend)
2. Server (backend)
3. `shinyApp()`

---

## `app.R` üìÑ

```r
library(shiny)
ui <- fluidPage(
  "Hello, world!"
) 
server <- function(input, output, session) {
}
shinyApp(ui, server)

```

---

# Which are the main components of a Shiny App?

**1. User interface (frontend)**
Nested R functions that assemble an HTML user interface for your app

**2. Server (backend)**
A function with instructions on how to build and rebuild the R objects displayed in the UI

**3. `shinyApp()`**
combines ui and server into a functioning app. Wrap with `runApp()` if calling from a sourced script or inside a function

## Interactivity 
In computer science, interactive refers to software which accepts and responds to input from people‚Äîfor example, data or commands.


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.height=300, out.width=400}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(plotly)
ggpenguins <- qplot(bill_length_mm , body_mass_g, 
data = palmerpenguins::penguins, color = species)
ggplotly(ggpenguins)
```

# What is reactivity and how to implement it? {background-color="#FED9B7"}






---

## Reactivity
> _..."users change input controls (dragging sliders, typing in textboxes, checking checkboxes, ‚Ä¶) which causes logic to run **on the server** (reading CSVs, subsetting data, fitting models, ‚Ä¶) ultimately resulting in outputs updating (plots redrawing, tables updating, ‚Ä¶)."_

```{r,echo = FALSE, out.width=450, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/reactivity-4.png")
```

# Is the same to say reactive than interactive?
No...

---

## Interactive

* It is **not required connection to a server**

* It is not needed **a widget** (for example, a slider)

* Limited (what happen if we want to change the variable assigned to the the x-axis?)

* This kind of interactivity is provided by the plotting library (for example, `Altair`)

---

## Reactivity


* We need to add **widgets** to allow the user interact with the app and send a message to the server

* We have to üîå **connect** the user interface to the server.

* For that, we need to use a specialized dashboard library (for example, `Shiny` or `Dash`)

# Reactivity

## What do we need to create a reactive app?

- Input functions
- Output functions (x2)

All these functions are part of Shiny
---

## Input functions (also called widgets)
Collects values from the user

![](img/inputs.png)
---

## Outputs
`render*()` and `*Output()` functions work together to add R output to the UI

## Learning objectives {background-color="#FED9B7"}


1. Define what is a dashboard.

2. Differentiate reactivity and interactivity.

3. Identify the **server** and the **user interface** as the core elements that compose a dashboard.

4. Implement the **reactivity** connecting the server and the user interface using specific functions.

5. Create and run a basic Shiny R app.
